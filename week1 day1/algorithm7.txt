Q) Write an algorithm to find the product of first n odd numbers

step1: start
step2: read the value of n
step3: initilize i=1, mul=1, count=1
step4: repeatedly execute the steps (i)-(iii) until (count<=n)
       (i) mul=mul*i
       (ii) i=i+2
       (iii) count=count+1
step4: print mul
step5: stop
